# DeathLocator
'Death Locator' is a fully-clientside Minecraft mod with the intent of nothing more than providing the coordinates of your previous death. The text is programmed to disappear upon reaching the location, upon item despawn, or performing the /cleardeath command.

If playing on a non-integrated server, setting your render distance to the server's view distance (usually 10) is highly recommended. Else, the despawn timer will not behave correctly.

## Text Colour Information
Dark yellow text indicates your death location is not currently loaded, and items will not despawn.

White text indicates your death location is currently loaded. Items will despawn!

Red text indicates your items will despawn if loaded for another 1,200 ticks (60 seconds).
