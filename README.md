# DeathLocator
Clientside Minecraft mod for tracking player death locations.
If playing on a non-integrated server, setting your render distance to the server's view distance (usually 10) is highly recommended. Else, the despawn timer will not behave correctly.

Dark yellow text indicates your death location is not currently loaded, and items will not despawn.

White text indicates your death location is currently loaded. Items will despawn!

Red text indicates your items will despawn if loaded for another 1,200 ticks (60 seconds).
